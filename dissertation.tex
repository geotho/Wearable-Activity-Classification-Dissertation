\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

  The aims of the project are:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item to classify activities based on accelerometer recordings from a consumer smartwatch and smartphone; and
    \item evaluate to what extent the smartwatch is better at helping to classify activities.
  \end{enumerate}

\section*{Work Completed}

  I have built an Android smartphone app and an Android Wear smartwatch app that allows a user to collect accelerometer data from both devices simultaneously. I collect over five hours of accelerometer data over a range of activities. I extracted features from time divisions of the data and used a set of classifiers to classify the activities. I evaluate the performance of each classifier on the set of activities when given access to only the watch data, only the phone data and both the watch and phone data together.

\section*{Declaration}

I, George Thomas of Peterhouse, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer
Science Tripos, hereby declare
that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work,
unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation
does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial
extent for a comparable purpose.
